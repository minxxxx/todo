<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles vectors.

An instance can be contructed with an array with this values :
- dest (instance of Vertex)
- orig (optionnal, instance of Vertex)

The class provides the following methods :

Float   getX();
Float   getY();
Float   getZ();
Float   getW();

Float   magnitude();
Returns vector's length

Vector   normalize();
Returns new instance of Vector class normalized

Vector add( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the sum between current Vector and $rhs in new instance of Vector class

Vector sub( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the substract between current Vector and $rhs in new instance of Vector class

Vector opposite()
Returns the opposite of the current Vector in new instance of Vector class

Vector scalarProduct( $k )
Returns the result of the scalar product between current Vector and the scalar $k in new instance of Vector class

Float dotProduct( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the scalar product between current Vector and the vector $rhs in new instance of Vector class

Float cos( Vector $rhs )
Returns vectors's cos

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the cross product between current Vector and the vector $rhs in new instance of Vector class

You can enable verbose mode with the static var Vertex::$verbose.
